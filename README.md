# Selenium-Test-for-CommitQuality.com
The main purpose behind this project was to help familiarize myself with selenium and automation testing in general. As the focus was just Selenium I've kept the tools I used to just selenium and the chrome browser.  Perhaps in the future I'll do another project that makes use of Selenium in tandem with an test framework.
